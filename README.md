Synopsis

A project to learn how NFTs work and practice smart contract development.

On a web page user has the ability to connect MetaMask wallet and mint one of 1000 NFTs.
Each NFT has different health and attack values.
Each user can only have one NFT.
There's a boss with HP and attack value.
User attacks the boss and gets attacked in return.
On the back-end transaction occurs and updates NFT health values with each attack.
The stack of languages and tools I used:

Back-end: Solidity, Hardhat, JS to handle the deployment.
Front-end: ReactJS, Vite, ethers.js to connect front-end with the back-end.
